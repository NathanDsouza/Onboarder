# Poker Pals!

Now on the playstore!!! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pokerpals

## Purpose:

This app is perfect for when you want to play poker with friends but only have cards and no chips. Users are able to create private rooms that their friends can join, which then simulates betting with virtual chips. This app currently tracks pot, stacks and bets. This is the very first, functioning version with many more features and UI upgrades to come. Stay tuned!

## Inspiration

This app started off as a way to become more proficient with react native, redux and firebase as I would be working with all three of those during my co-op at the time. In addition to this I would be focusing on fixing up the Onboarding process so I figured what better way to become more familiar than to create an app that goes through the onboarding process. After I finished the sign-up screens I thought it would be fun to create an app that I would actually use and frankly needed as someone who usually has cards on him but never lugs around chips. 

## Features to come

* Automate blinds
* Keep track of last action
* Ability to leave rooms
* Implement room clean up once all users leave room
* Call, fold, raise buttons based on previous action
* Indicate the current street
* Loading spinner for landing page to allow firebase to finish it's check
* UI upgrade!
* Fix default font error
